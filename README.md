# Summary of Insights
## Orders
- Airpods have consistently been the contributing to the most number of orders since 2019, averaging 40% of total orders throughout the period, followed by charging pack and gaming monitors. These 3 products easily accounts for 80-90% of all orders of the platform.
- Since mid-2021, orders across the product caterogies have steadily decreased. This could indicate that there are underlying operational or marketing issues causing the firm to have a reduction in orders.

## Sales
- While charging pack has the second highest number of orders, it has marginal contribution to total sales. Whereas, Airpods, gaming monitor and Macbook Air contributes up to 80% of total sales across the years. Gaming monitor had the highest sales in Dec 2019 (43%) due to covid where most office workers are working from home.

## Average Time to Ship
- Average time to ship indicates the operational efficiencies of the platform. The ***high variability in average shipping time (1 to 6 days) could be detrimental to the platform***. Even though the "outliers" are caused by products that are lesser bought (e.g. Bose Headphones, iPhone),  it illustrates ***inefficiencies in inventory management and delivery operations***.


# Recommendations and Next Steps
- Investigate root cause for higher average time to ship for less frequently ordered products, and is there any difference in handling of such orders compared to most frequently ordered products (e.g. Airpods).
- Conduct further ***analysis on customer behaviour to increase sales conversion rate***. For example, charging pack and webcams are most frequently bought products on mobile app while, Airpods and gaming monitor are more frequently bought through website. This indicates that customers have prefer to make purchases of branded products via website. One of the reasons could be trying to establish the authenticity of the listing. Upon identifying such behaviours, the platform can entice customers to make purchases by providing potentially app only or website only promos for certain products. 
- While regional trends are similar, conduct an analysis for different regions to identify which regions are performing poorer and the root cause of it. There are obvious product preferences for the different regions, hence ***inventory management could be better optimized to meet these demands*** and prevent holding products that are not popular in these regions.
